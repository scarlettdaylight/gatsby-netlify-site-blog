    The world has trillions of assets and securities ripe for digitization. Digitization of assets and securities is a 
    technological innovation that can bring benefits such as increased liquidity, faster settlement, fractional trading, 
    and trustless and immutable transactions. Plutux Exchange provides a trusted liquidity venue for digitized assets and 
    securities, often called “security tokens”, to trade and settle. Plutux is Hong Kong based and Asia focused, initially 
    only accepting professional or accredited investors under a fully regulated framework. Our business and technology are 
    built through top-in-class talent, responsible innovation, and strict adherence to regulations. We are here to lead 
    the digital evolution and trading of assets and securities!
