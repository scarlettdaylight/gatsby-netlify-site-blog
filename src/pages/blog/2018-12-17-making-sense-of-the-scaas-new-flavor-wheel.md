You perhaps have heard about the behavioral artistics news related to Banksy’s self-destruction art “Girl With Balloon” in Sotheby’s London auction. After the paint was hammered for 1 million  pound sterlings, it was shredded automatically by a remote control mechanism inserted by the artist Banksy himself. The price was as three times as that painting was expected to achieve and also a new record for Banksy. Later, Banksy posted the painting’s self-destruction video on his Instagram account quoted Picasso: “The urge to destroy is also a creative urge”. From this piece of news, we are able to take a glimpse into the wild and creative minds of artists.

Artists are no longer satisfied with the art industry dominated by centralised institutions. The channel for diffusion of art needs to be revolutionised. Blockchain technology is currently changing the business landscape of art area.
